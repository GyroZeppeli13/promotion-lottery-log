Based on the provided `git diff` records, here are some review comments on the code changes:

**General Observations:**

1. **Refactoring:** The codebase seems to be undergoing a major refactoring, with changes in package names, class names, and interfaces. This is a good practice to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. However, it's important to ensure that all references to the old classes and interfaces are updated accordingly to avoid any runtime issues.

2. **New Classes and Interfaces:** Several new classes and interfaces have been introduced, such as `CreatePartakeOrderAggregate`, `ActivityAccountDayEntity`, `ActivityAccountMonthEntity`, `PartakeRaffleActivityEntity`, `UserRaffleOrderEntity`, and `UserRaffleOrderStateVO`. These new classes and interfaces seem to be related to the implementation of a new feature or functionality. It's important to ensure that these new classes and interfaces are well-documented and follow the established coding standards.

3. **Database Routing:** The codebase seems to be implementing database routing using the `@DBRouter` annotation. This is a good practice for scaling the application horizontally. However, it's important to ensure that the database routing logic is correctly implemented and tested.

4. **Error Handling:** The code seems to be using the `AppException` class for error handling. This is a good practice as it allows for consistent error handling across the application. However, it's important to ensure that all possible error scenarios are handled appropriately.

**Specific Comments:**

1. **promotion-lottery-domain/src/main/java/cn/happy/domain/activity/service/IRaffleActivityPartakeService.java:**
    - The `createOrder` method should be documented to explain the purpose of the method and the parameters.
    - The method should also handle the case where the `partakeRaffleActivityEntity` is null.

2. **promotion-lottery-domain/src/main/java/cn/happy/domain/activity/service/partake/RaffleActivityPartakeService.java:**
    - The `doFilterAccount` method should be documented to explain the purpose of the method and the parameters.
    - The method should also handle the case where the `userId` or `activityId` is null.
    - The `buildUserRaffleOrder` method should be documented to explain the purpose of the method and the parameters.

3. **promotion-lottery-infrastructure/src/main/java/cn/happy/infrastructure/adapter/repository/ActivityRepository.java:**
    - The `saveCreatePartakeOrderAggregate` method seems to be implementing a complex transaction. It's important to ensure that this method is well-tested and handles all possible error scenarios.
    - The method should also be documented to explain the purpose of the method and the parameters.

4. **promotion-lottery-infrastructure/src/main/java/cn/happy/infrastructure/dao/IRaffleActivityAccountDao.java:**
    - The new methods added to the `IRaffleActivityAccountDao` interface should be documented to explain their purpose and parameters.

5. **promotion-lottery-infrastructure/src/main/java/cn/happy/infrastructure/dao/IUserRaffleOrderDao.java:**
    - The `@DBRouterStrategy(splitTable = true)` annotation should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly implemented and tested.

**Overall, the code changes seem to be well-structured and follow good coding practices. However, it's important to ensure that all new classes and interfaces are well-documented and that all possible error scenarios are handled appropriately. Additionally, the database routing logic and the complex transaction in the `saveCreatePartakeOrderAggregate` method should be thoroughly tested.**
