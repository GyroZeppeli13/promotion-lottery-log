This code review will focus on the changes made in the provided `git diff` records, highlighting potential issues, improvements, and maintaining code quality.

### General Observations:

1. **New DTOs and Entities**: New Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Entities such as `SkuProductResponseDTO`, `SkuProductShopCartRequestDTO`, `SkuProductEntity`, and `UnpaidActivityOrderEntity` have been introduced. This suggests an expansion in the functionality, likely related to managing SKU products and handling unpaid orders.

2. **Interface Changes**: The `IRaffleActivityService` interface has been expanded with new methods for querying SKU products, user credit accounts, and handling credit payments for SKU exchanges. This indicates a broader scope of the service, possibly to support e-commerce functionalities within the lottery promotion system.

3. **Database Changes**: New SQL queries and updates in the mapper XML files indicate modifications in how data is retrieved and manipulated, particularly focusing on unpaid orders and user credit accounts.

4. **Concurrency Handling**: The code now includes Redis locks to handle concurrency issues, particularly in scenarios where multiple threads might attempt to access and modify the same data simultaneously.

5. **Testing**: New test cases have been added to cover the new functionalities, ensuring that the changes do not break existing functionalities and that new features work as expected.

### Detailed Review:

1. **DTOs and Entities**:
   - Ensure that all new DTOs and Entities are properly documented with comments explaining their purpose and usage.
   - Verify that the `@Data` annotation from Lombok is appropriate for these classes, considering the need for immutability and thread safety in some contexts.

2. **Interface Changes**:
   - The new methods in `IRaffleActivityService` should be reviewed to ensure they align with the overall architecture and that the service does not become too bloated with responsibilities.
   - Consider the implications of adding new methods to a service interface, such as the need for implementing these methods in all concrete classes.

3. **Database Changes**:
   - The new SQL queries should be reviewed for efficiency and correctness. Ensure that indexes are properly used to optimize query performance.
   - The changes in the `user_credit_account_mapper.xml` file, specifically the addition of `account_status = 'open'` to the query, should be validated to ensure it aligns with the business logic.

4. **Concurrency Handling**:
   - The use of Redis locks should be carefully reviewed to ensure they are implemented correctly and that they do not introduce new bottlenecks or single points of failure.
   - Consider alternative concurrency control mechanisms if Redis locks are not the best fit for the system's requirements.

5. **Testing**:
   - The new test cases should cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions, to ensure robustness.
   - Verify that the tests are not only checking for successful operations but also for proper error handling and exception throwing.

### Recommendations:

1. **Refactoring**: Consider refactoring the code to separate concerns more clearly, possibly by creating new services or repositories to handle the new functionalities related to SKU products and credit payments.

2. **Documentation**: Ensure that all new code is well-documented, including comments explaining the purpose of classes, methods, and significant code blocks.

3. **Code Quality**: Use static analysis tools to check for potential code quality issues such as code duplication, unused variables, and potential bugs.

4. **Performance**: Monitor the performance impact of the new changes, particularly the new database queries and the use of Redis locks.

5. **Security**: Review the code for potential security vulnerabilities, especially in areas where user data is handled and where external systems are integrated.

Overall, the changes seem to be well-structured and follow good coding practices. However, careful consideration should be given to the expanded scope of the service and the potential impact on system performance and security.
