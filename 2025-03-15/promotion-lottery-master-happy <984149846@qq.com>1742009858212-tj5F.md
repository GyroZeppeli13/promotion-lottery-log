Based on the provided `git diff` records, here's a review of the changes made to the codebase:

1. **Database Schema Changes**:
    - New tables `raffle_activity_account_flow_000`, `raffle_activity_account_flow_001`, `raffle_activity_account_flow_002`, `raffle_activity_account_flow_003` have been created, which seems to be a sharding approach for the `raffle_activity_account_flow` table.
    - Similar sharding approach has been applied to the `raffle_activity_order` table, with new tables `raffle_activity_order_000`, `raffle_activity_order_001`, `raffle_activity_order_002`, `raffle_activity_order_003`.
    - Sample data has been inserted into the `raffle_activity`, `raffle_activity_count`, and `raffle_activity_order_000`, `raffle_activity_order_001`, `raffle_activity_order_002`, `raffle_activity_order_003` tables.

2. **Code Changes**:
    - New dependencies `easy-random-core` and `db-router-spring-boot-starter` have been added to the `pom.xml` and `promotion-lottery-app/pom.xml`. This indicates the use of a library for generating random data and a database routing library for sharding.
    - The `application-dev.yml` file has been updated to include configurations for the `mini-db-router`, which seems to be the database sharding configuration. The default database is set to `db00`, and two additional databases `db01` and `db02` are configured.
    - New MyBatis mapper XML files have been added for `raffle_activity_account_flow`, `raffle_activity_account`, `raffle_activity_count`, `raffle_activity`, and `raffle_activity_order`. These XML files contain SQL queries and mappings for the respective entities.
    - New test classes `RaffleActivityDaoTest` and `RaffleActivityOrderDaoTest` have been added. These classes contain tests for the DAO methods to ensure they are functioning correctly.

3. **Overall Impression**:
    - The changes indicate a migration towards a sharded database architecture to handle scalability and performance.
    - The addition of the `easy-random-core` library suggests a need for generating random test data, possibly for testing the application under various scenarios.
    - The codebase seems to be well-structured, with clear separation of concerns and proper use of Spring annotations and MyBatis for database interactions.
    - The test classes demonstrate a commitment to testing, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and identifying issues early.

**Recommendations**:
- Ensure that the sharding logic is thoroughly tested, especially edge cases involving multiple shards.
- Verify that the application handles database connections and transactions correctly in a sharded environment.
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests, including integration tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios.
- Document the sharding strategy and any assumptions made in the code to aid future development and maintenance.
