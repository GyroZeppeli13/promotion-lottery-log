Based on the provided `git diff` records, I will review the code changes and provide feedback:

1. **SQL Script Changes (`promotion-lottery.sql`)**:
   - The changes involve updating the `strategy_award` table with new entries and modifying the `strategy_rule` table.
   - It appears that the probabilities of winning certain awards have been adjusted, and new rules have been added for the `rule_weight` type.
   - The dates in the `strategy_award` table suggest that these changes are for a future promotion, possibly in October 2024.
   - It's important to ensure that these changes align with the overall promotion strategy and that the probabilities are correctly calculated to avoid any unintended consequences.

2. **Java Code Changes (`RaffleOrderTest.java`, `AwardServiceTest.java`, `CreditAdjustServiceTest.java`, `BehaviorRebateServiceTest.java`, `RaffleActivityControllerTest.java`, `RaffleStrategyControllerTest.java`)**:
   - The changes primarily involve updating the user ID from "xiaofuge" to "zhr" in various test cases.
   - This change seems to be for testing purposes, possibly to use a different test user.
   - It's important to ensure that the new user ID "zhr" has the necessary setup in the test environment to accurately simulate the intended test scenarios.

3. **Java Code Changes (`IAwardPort.java`, `IAwardRepository.java`, `GptAccountAward.java`, `GptCouponAward.java`, `UserCreditRandomAward.java`, `AwardPort.java`, `AwardRepository.java`, `GptAccountServiceRPC.java`, `GptCouponServiceRPC.java`)**:
   - The changes involve adding an `orderId` parameter to the `grantProductToAccount` and `receiveCoupon` methods to ensure idempotency and prevent duplicate awards.
   - The `AwardRepository` class has been updated to handle the new `orderId` parameter and to update the award record status before calling the external services.
   - The `GptAccountServiceRPC` and `GptCouponServiceRPC` classes have been updated to pass the `orderId` to the external services.
   - These changes are positive as they improve the robustness of the award distribution process by preventing duplicate awards and ensuring that the award records are correctly updated.

Overall, the changes seem to be well thought out and aim to improve the functionality and robustness of the promotion lottery system. It's important to thoroughly test these changes, especially the new award distribution logic, to ensure that it works as expected and does not introduce any new issues.
